I’m a Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Previously, I worked as an ASIC Design Engineer at SiFive, where I focused on RISC-V–based SoC development. My background includes experience in digital electronics, computer architecture, and FPGA design, and I enjoy working on challenges at the intersection of hardware design and emerging technology.
